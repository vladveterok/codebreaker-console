    \nIn Codebreaker you'll, well, you'll obviously break a SECRET CODE created by me. Yes, human, Me.\nMy ENIGMATIC CODE will be of four digits, each between 1 and 6.
    \nThe number of trials and hints available depends on the chosen difficulty.\nYour challenge is to guess this MIGHTY CODE by fruitlessly trying out different combinations.
    \nEach time you make your silly guess, I'll generously give you a clue about how close you're to crack my SUPER-SECRET UNBREAKABLE CODE. You'll see '+' and '-' signs:\n
    \n+: correct digit placed correctly
    \n-: correct digit placed incorrectly\n
    \nCases when you don't see these signs mean that you're stupid enough not to guess any digit even closely.
    Have fun! (Or not.)(I DON'T CARE!!11)
    \n==================================\n"
